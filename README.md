# ToggleAudio Extension

## Next Version

Known issues that will be fixed:

* Sometimes the first button will miss, cause the devices are not ready. This will be fixed in the next minor version

Queued:

* Change Toggle Button to ToggleButton with Menu, and move Pref to this menu instead of pref settings.
