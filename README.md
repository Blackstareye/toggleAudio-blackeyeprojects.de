# ToggleAudio Extension

## Tested on

with 2 audio devices:

* Gnome 46:
  * Ubuntu 24.04 (hardware)
* Gnome 45:
    * Ubuntu 23.10 (VM)
    * Nobara 39

## Next Version

Ideas:

* Disable Toggle Button as long Connection is not possible instead just queuing  
* Change Toggle Button to ToggleButton with Menu, and move Pref to this menu instead of pref settings.

their code helped me to understand `Gvc.MixerControl` better.

Also thanks to #extensions:gnome.org (Matrix) and their people for helping me :)
