# ToggleAudio Extension

Settings

![shows settings](img/settings.png)

set your `headphone` and `speaker` devices in preferences

then you can switch between those `devices` with a click of a button:

![speaker](img/speaker.png) ![headphone](img/headphone.png)

(you can see the switch between the audio sources in the volume output device window above called `Tonausgang` here)

 Note: the devices for `headphone` and `speaker` must be two separated devices, and not a shared one with different ports (like build in Speaker/Headphone devices).

 In that case only one device can be seen in the preference selection window.

 With the `Show Indicator` switch you can also control if you want to show a system icon tray or not.
 If `true` the icon is shown.

## Hotkeys

 You can also use `hotkeys` for:

* toggle Speaker/ Headphone
  * default: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>
* select Speaker
  * default: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>
* select Headphone
  * default: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>

You can `enable` those in the settings:

![settings show hotkey area](img/settings_2.png)

> if you want to change the hotkeys, you need to do those in gsettings using `gsettings`
